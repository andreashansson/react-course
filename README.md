HOW?
You need NPM to install all dependencies.

We will use webpack as a bundler which is a dependencie.

We will use Babel as compiler.

We will use a deveopment server to test our app localy.

I think we will use react create-app to setup all things.
But he will in the end of the course go through how to set up all these things manually.

#Download NodeJS from https://nodejs.org

#Install create-react-app.
npm install -g create-react-app

# Use and create a new react app.
1. create-react-app burger-app
2. cd burger-app
3. npm start
